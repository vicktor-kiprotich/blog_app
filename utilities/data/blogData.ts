        "In ADA cases, prevailing plaintiffs are often awarded what’s known as compensatory damages. These, along with punitive damages, help make up the sum of penalties owed by defendants found guilty of ADA violations. In this piece, we will provide a brief introduction to compensatory damages  and the role they serve in ADA cases. What are compensatory damages? The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) defines compensatory damages as legal damages that “pay victims for out-of-pocket expenses caused by the discrimination (such as costs associated with a  job search or medical expenses).” The EEOC also explains that compensatory damages may also cover “any emotional harm suffered (such as mental anguish, inconvenience, or loss of enjoyment of life).” To put it another way, compensatory damages cover the financial costs that a prevailing  plaintiff suffers as a result of a claimed offense. Are there damages other than compensatory? Compensatory damages differ from punitive damages. Punitive damages serve the sole purpose of reprimanding a defendant. The logic behind these damages is that they will deter the guilty  defendant from committing similar future offenses. The different kinds of compensatory damages There are two kinds of compensatory damages. The first is special damages. Special damages refer to easily calculable damages. Medical bills, for instance, count as an easily calculable amount because their value is confirmed. The other kind of compensatory damages is what’s known as general damages. These refer to reparations for items  such as pain, suffering, and emotional well-being. These damages are difficult to calculate as the amount required to satisfy them is much more subjective than in special damages.",
